# cookoutcombinatorics

Calculating the number of different ways you can order a tray (or jr. tray) from Cookout restaurants in the mid-Atlantic
states.  Written in support of an [article on the subject at WRAL.com](https://wral.com/21495740)

## Method
Cookout trays consist of an entree (20 to choose from), two sides (136 total combinations), and a beverage (56 including
45 milkshake flavors).

## Results
This makes for a possible 152,320 possible trays.
See [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtphokie/cookoutcombinatorics/main/order_combinations.text) for the
complete listing. The addition of watermelon to the list of shake flavors in July adds another
2,400 combinations. Eggnog and Peppermint add another 4,800 in December.

If you consider the 262,143 combinations of the 18 available condiments and toppings for the 3 burgers and 3 chicken
sandwiches, and the 3 ways you can order your hotdog (they'll ask), diners have 11,979,076,928 ways to order a Cookout tray.

## Calories
Trays range from 440 calories or the Jr. tray with a chicken quesadilla, double up slaw, and a bottled water or Diet
Coke to the 2639 calories for 
chicken strip sandwich with a doubled up ranch chicken wrap, and a cherry cheesecake shake (2639 calories)
